# Mall-Customers-data-set-Clustering
## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for performing unsupervised clustering on a mall customers dataset. The main clustering algorithms utilized are KMeans, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN. Unsupervised clustering is employed to identify patterns and groupings within the dataset, shedding light on potential customer segments based on their behavior.

## Clustering Algorithms
### 1. KMeans Clustering
KMeans is employed to partition the dataset into 'k' distinct, non-overlapping subgroups.
Tune the number of clusters 'k' based on insights gained from the analysis.

### 2. Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters, representing the relationships between different data points.
Visualization of the dendrogram will aid in understanding the hierarchical structure.

### 3. DBSCAN Clustering
DBSCAN identifies clusters based on dense regions of data points, allowing for the discovery of irregularly shaped clusters.
Adjust the epsilon and minimum samples parameters to control the cluster density.

## Visualizations
The visualizations directory contains visual representations of the clustering results, including scatter plots and dendrograms.

## Conclusion
Explore the clustering results to gain insights into distinct customer segments within the mall customers dataset. Feel free to experiment with parameters and further analyze the clusters to inform business strategies and marketing approaches.

For detailed information, please refer to the Jupyter notebook and code comments.
Happy clustering!
